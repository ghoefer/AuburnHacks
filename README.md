# Mazevo
Mazevo was awarded **second place** at Auburn Hacks!

This project was developed as our Auburn University Hackathon project submission. We developed the above code in 24 hours, after given a prompt/topic of helping people in natural disasters. We came up with the idea for and fully designed Mazevo, an app to help victims send a help signal or find a place to stay in case of emergency. Additionally, we programmed hardware using an arduino kit to send users location to the app during emergency situations, and coded a skill on Alexa to pair with the app in case the user couldn’t get to a device.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration stems from a story that took place during a massive ice storm a few years ago. People were stranded but managed to get help by connecting through facebook. They were able to stay at each other’s homes when others were on the road in the bitter cold. We wanted to build something that people could use to help find places they could go in natural disaster situations. We particularly wanted to target our product for individuals with disabilities and the elderly.
